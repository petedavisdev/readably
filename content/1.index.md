Hi, I'm Pete Davis. 

I'm a Principal Engineer at the Royal College of Nursing.

The biggest mistake I made early in my career was thinking that the goal was to make my code as concices as possible.

Sometimes when you look at answers on Stack Overflow, it seems like a competition to use the least lines of code possible.

Working on a large lagacy codebase, I felt it was my responsibility to not add more code than necessary and further impair the performance of the website. In hindsight, the real drag on performance was the huge chunks of code that nobody was willing to touch because it was difficult to read and change.

These days all our code is minified and compressed before it is served to clients, so you shouldn't be concerned about typing as few characters as possible.

Code formatters like Prettier have helped us make our code more readable, simply by stopping us from cramming too much into each line of code.

However, it is still tempting to try to get the job done with the minimum of typing. Being terse makes us feel clever, but it's a trap.

When you write code, it can feels like your are writing something for a machine, but you're not. The reason we have human-readable languages like JavaScript is not for the benefit of machines, it's for the benefit of humans.

Consider these two examples.

```JavaScript
const f = (s) => `${s.options[s.selectedIndex].text} is ${["bear", "cat"].includes(s.value) ? '' : 'not '}a mammal`;
document.getElementById("select-animal").addEventListener('change', e => alert(f(e.target)));
```

```JavaScript
const MAMMALS = ["bear", "cat"];

const animalSelectElement = document.getElementById("select-animal");

animalSelectElement.addEventListener("change", () => alertMammal());

function alertMammal() {
  const animalIndex = animalSelectElement.selectedIndex;
  const animalText = animalSelectElement.options[animalIndex].text;
  
  const animalValue = animalSelectElement.value;
  const isMammal = MAMMALS.includes(animalValue);

  const mammalMessage = `${animalText} ${isMammal ? 'is' : 'is not'} a mammal`;

  alert(mammalMessage);
}
```

Both achieve the exact same thing

- The first is 2 lines made up of 205 characters
- The second is 17 lines of code made up of 534 characters!

So the first appears to be 62% smaller, and if we were writing code for machines it would be better.

However, after being minified and gzipped ready to serve on the web:

- The first is 205 bytes
- The second is 228 bytes

So in production, the first is only 10% smaller, and those 23 bytes are just not worth what you sacrifice in readability.

Code this descriptive will take a little longer to write, but what you loose in writing time, you gain many times over by making it easy to understand.

- Faster code reviews
- Quicker to find and fix bugs
- Simpler to change, extend and refactor
- Easier for new developers to contribute

With Readably, I am on a mission to make coding more human. 

When you write code, think about whether your past self from 5 years ago would have understood it. Think about how happy your future self in 5 years time will be to maintain it.

Most of all, think about your colleagues. If you left tomorrow, will they be cursing you for the mess you left behind, or grateful for the time you took to make your code readable?
